# Sublist-generator
Functions in JS and Python to generate sublists for any given list/array. Functions take one argument (l) which is a list/array.

[Generates all possible sublists of a given list. Code ignores sublists containing originally non-adjacent elements at adjacent indexes. Output is an array with nested arrays.]
